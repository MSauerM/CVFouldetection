# CVFouldetection

## Description
CV-Fouldetection is the application developed for my master thesis in Computer Vision about the topic of automatic video-based detection of fouls in soccer using 
OpenCV and Python. 

## Installation

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Python 3.7 (64-bit version) installed

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `venv` (ideally using Python 3.7) via `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment` and activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`

   <b>More information for creating virtual enviroments:</b> [https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) 

3. Install requirements saved in requirements.txt via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Navigate to `main.py` and run the main method
5. Now you should see a GUI for you to choose a video file

<b>Notice</b>: If you cloned the repository with PyCharm or manually, by opening the project with PyCharm there will be an automatic dialog for you to choose to let PyCharm 
create a `venv`, if there is no `venv` up to this point, and also install the packages in `requirements.txt` to this created `venv`.
